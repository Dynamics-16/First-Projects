            <p>This is my first-ever website! At the moment I'm only using HTML and CSS.</p>
            <p>I have a lot to learn but hopefully in the next few months I will be more proficient!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Here are some things that I <strong>can do</strong> to make myself more comfortable</p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practice every day!</li>
                    <li>Start projects!</li>
                    <li>Watch videos!</li>
                    <li>Read books!</li>
                    <li>Get opinions of my code!</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
                <p>I started coding around 2-3 weeks ago, towards the end of December 2023. I will be commencing a certificate 3 in I.T in early March 2024. The course will be completely online and self-paced and I have upto 12 months to fully complete the course. I'd like to complete the course a little sooner than 12 months, within 6-9 months would be ideal.</p>

                <p>I'm hoping the Certificate 3 will help me gain a better understanding of HTML and CSS. After I complete the certificate 3, I am considering to start a Diploma of I.T in early 2025. Once the Diploma is finished, I will consider going to university to complete a bachelor degree in Information Technology.</p>

        <h2 id="things-I-need-to-improve">Things I need to improve!</h2>

        <p>There are definitely many things I need to work on. In due course I'm sure I will get a whole lot better! Right now, here are the main focuses (off the top of my head):</p>
        <br>

        <ol>
            <li>The overall structure of my HTML
                <p>I'm slowly getting used to the structure of HTML - where certain elements should be placed, what should (and shouldn't) be nested inside other elements and the bare requirements for a HTML document. </p>

                <p>The code below is an example that displays the essential elements within a HTML document!</p>

                <pre><code>
                    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
                    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
                    &lt;head&gt;
                        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
                        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
                        &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
                    &lt;/head&gt;
                    &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
                    &lt;/body&gt;
                    &lt;/html&gt;
                </code></pre>

                <p>It was only the other day when I learnt about the "code" element and HTML "entities"! <em>Kinda cool, hey?</em></p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>CSS-overall
                <p>Now this is something that is certainly going to take some time to get somewhat decent at! There's lot of people online saying "oh, you can learn CSS in 2 weeks". This statement (at least for me) is simply untrue. I'm having a little bit of a hard time trying to grasp CSS, there seems to be so much to learn! Of course, with practice every day I will improve my skills! </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="a-timeline">A Timeline</h2>

        <p>I thought it'd be good practice to create a timeline (or maybe just a table) of my coding adventure, something I can edit throughout.</p>

        <table border="2">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Date</th>
                    <th>Description</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>DEC 2023</td>
                    <td>First started coding, using websites for assistance. (Especially, FreeCodeCamp)
                    </td>
                </tr>

                <tr>
                    <td>JAN 2024</td>
                    <td>Started first "website" - This HTML document you're currently reading</td>
                </tr>
                    <td>FEB 2024</td>
                    <td>Delving into the world of JavaScript</td>
                <tr>
                    <td>MAR 2024</td>
                    <td>Projected start date of Certificate 3 in I.T (Web Development Stream)</td>
                </tr>

        <h2 id="javascript-basics">JavaScript "Basics"</h2>

        <p>I have just started to learn JavaScript (27/01/2024). I think it may be a good idea to note some things down from what I learn, this way I get the best of both worlds - I can continue learning JavaScript and also practice my HTML in the process! </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <pre><code>&lt;Script&gt;&lt;/Script&gt;</code></pre>
                <p>This element is used to load Javascript into your HTML file! Don't forget to include the src attribute (i.e. ./script.js).</p>
                <p>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element in HTML can be placed in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section or the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section of your HTML document. The placement depends on what you are trying to achieve.</p>
                <br>
                <p><strong>Here are the considerations for each placement:</strong></p>
                <p><em>In the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section:</em></p>
                <p>Placing scripts in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section is common when the script contains functions, variables, or other code that needs to be loaded before the rest of the page.</p>
                <p>This is often the case when you want to define functions or variables that are going to be used throughout your entire document.</p>
                <br>
                <p><em>Before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag:</em></p>

                <p>Placing scripts just before the closing <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tag is common when you want to ensure that the HTML content is loaded before the scripts are executed.</p>
                <p>This can improve the perceived page load time because the browser doesn't have to wait for the scripts to be downloaded and executed before rendering the page.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <pre><code>var</code></pre>
                <p>In JavaScript a variable is used to hold a value. To use a variable you must first <em>declare</em> it! For example:</p>
                <pre><code>var camperbot;</code></pre>
                <p><em>As you can see, <strong>camperbot</strong> is the variable!</em></p>
                <p>Variables can be assigned a value. When you do this while you declare it, this is called <strong>initialization</strong>. For example:</p>
                <pre><code>var camperbot = "Bot";</code></pre>
                <p><em>This would initialize the camperbot variable with a value of <strong>Bot</strong>, a string.</em></p>
                <p>Do note: When a variable name has multiple words, the convention in JavaScript is to use what's called camelCase. The first word is lowercase, and the first letter of every following word is uppercase.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <pre><code>let</code></pre>
                <p>In modern JavaScript, it's best practice to use the keyword <code>let</code> instead of the keyword <code>var</code>.</p>
                <p>This fixes several unusual behaviors with var that can make your code difficult to debug.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <pre><code>const</code></pre>
                <p>If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the <code>const</code> keyword to declare it instead of the <code>let</code> keyword.</p>
                <p>This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><em><strong>Strings</strong></em></p>
                <p>JavaScript has multiple different data types. <em>Strings</em> are used to store things like words or text. <em>Strings</em> are surrounded with double quotes, single quotes, or backticks.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of declaring a variable with a string:</p>
                <pre><code>let developer = "Naomi";</code></pre>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><em><strong>Arrays</strong></em></p>
                <p>An <em>array</em> can be used to hold multiple values. For example:</p>
                <pre><code>let order = ["first", "second", "third"];</code></pre>
                <p>This is an <em>array</em> which holds three values. Notice how the values are separated by commas.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <p><code>getElementById()</code></p>
                <p>The <code>getElementById</code> method can "find" an HTML element and can change the element content.</p>
                <p>It can also change HTML attribute values, alter CSS styles and hide/show html elements!</p>
                <p>If you scroll down below, you can see a few examples of this!</p>
                <br>
            <li>
                <p><code>window.alert()</code></p>
                <p>The <code>window.alert()</code> method is used to display a dialog box with a specified message and an 'OK' button</p>
                <p>The 'window' object represents the global browser window or tab, and the 'alert' is a method attached to this object!</p>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="javascript-in-action">JavaScript in action!</h2>

        <p><em>Section started 04/02/2024.</em></p>
        <p>Here is a section where I can put some JavaScript to use! <strong><em>(Do note: I won't list everything I learn down)</em></strong></p>
        <p>I'll try my best to order things from easy to hard, although there may be more complex JavaScript mixed in with the easier stuff.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, FreeCodeCamp isn't functioning properly so I've had to resort to W3Schools. A lot of the following information is from W3Schools which I have written out myself.</p>
