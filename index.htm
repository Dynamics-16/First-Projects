        <p>This is my first-ever website! At the moment I'm only using HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>I have a lot to learn but hopefully in the next few months I will be more proficient!</p>

                    <li>Practice every day!</li>
                    <li>Start projects!</li>
                    <li>Watch videos!</li>
                    <li>Read books!</li>
                    <li>Get opinions of my code!</li>

                <p>I started coding around 2-3 weeks ago, towards the end of December 2023. I will be commencing a certificate 3 in I.T in early March 2024. The course will be completely online and self-paced and I have upto 12 months to fully complete the course. I'd like to complete the course a little sooner than 12 months, within 6-9 months would be ideal.</p>

                <p>I'm hoping the Certificate 3 will help me gain a better understanding of HTML and CSS. After I complete the certificate 3, I am considering to start a Diploma of I.T in early 2025. Once the Diploma is finished, I will consider going to university to complete a bachelor degree in Information Technology.</p>

    <p>Here are some websites I've used so far. Some are better than others, however they have all been useful to some degree! Feel free to check them out.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a></li>

    <p>My favourite website so far has been FreeCodeCamp. The structure of the curriculum has been awesome. This website has lots of content/projects to complete and it isn't only limited to HTML and CSS.</p>

    <h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>So far, the websites listed above have been very useful for me. They've helped me take my first baby steps into coding. However, there are some tools that I've identified that have also been a great help. I will list them below. 
    <br>
    (The list will be periodically updated as I find more tools in my journey)</p>
    <br>

<ul>
    <li>
        <h3>
            <a href="https://chat.openai.com">Chat GPT</a>
        </h3>
        <p>If you haven't already heard of it, ChatGPT is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. Based on a large language model, it enables users to refine and steer a conversation towards a desired length, format, style, level of detail, and language.

        <h3>
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

<h2 id="things-I-need-to-improve">Things I need to improve!</h2>

<p>There are definitely many things I need to work on. In due course I'm sure I will get a whole lot better! Right now, here are the main focuses (off the top of my head):</p>
<br>

<ol>
    <li>The overall structure of my HTML
        <p>I'm slowly getting used to the structure of HTML - where certain elements should be placed, what should (and shouldn't) be nested inside other elements and the bare requirements for a HTML document. </p>

        <p>The code below is an example that displays the essential elements within a HTML document!</p>

        <pre><code>
            &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
            &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
                &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;My Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
            &lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>

        <p>It was only the other day when I learnt about the "code" element and HTML "entities"! <em>Kinda cool, hey?</em></p>


    </li>
    <br>
    <li>CSS-overall
        <p>Now this is something that is certainly going to take some time to get somewhat decent at! There's lot of people online saying "oh, you can learn CSS in 2 weeks". This statement (at least for me) is simply untrue. I'm having a little bit of a hard time trying to grasp CSS, there seems to be so much to learn! Of course, with practice every day I will improve my skills! </p>
    </li>
</ol>
</section>


<section>

    <h2 id="a-timeline">A Timeline</h2>

    <p>I thought it'd be good practice to create a timeline (or maybe just a table) of my coding adventure, something I can edit throughout.</p>


    <table border="2">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>DEC 2023</td>
                <td>First started coding, using websites for assistance. (Especially, FreeCodeCamp)
                </td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>JAN 2024</td>
                <td>Started first "website" - This HTML document you're currently reading</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>MAR 2024</td>
                <td>Projected start date of Certificate 3 in I.T (Web Development Stream)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
